# cz - Commit Management CLI

`cz` is a command-line tool that helps developers craft well-structured commit messages. It provides an interactive experience for selecting commit types, scopes, and writing commit messages. The tool aims to make the process of creating consistent, semantic commit messages easier and more user-friendly.

## Features

- **Interactive Prompts**: Guides the user through a series of prompts to create well-structured commit messages.
- **Commit Types**: Support for standard commit types such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, and more.
- **Scope Selection**: Allows users to specify the scope of the commit, such as a module or feature.
- **Commit Message Generation**: Generates commit messages based on user input using a customizable template.

## Installation

## Usage

Once installed, you can use cz to create commit messages. Here's an example of how to use the tool:

### Commit Command

To start creating a commit message, run:

Commit Type: Select the type of commit (e.g., feat, fix, docs).
Scope: Optionally specify the scope of the commit.
Message: Write the main commit message.
